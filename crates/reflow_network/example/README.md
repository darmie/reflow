# Reflow Network WASM Examples

This directory contains comprehensive examples and tests for the Reflow Network WASM bindings.

## Files Overview

### Core Examples
- **`comprehensive_test.js`** - Complete test suite demonstrating all major features
- **`comprehensive_test.html`** - Interactive web interface for running tests
- **`actor_example.js`** - Basic actor system example
- **`actor_example.html`** - Simple web demo for actor examples

### Generated WASM Bindings
- **`../pkg/`** - Generated WASM bindings directory

  - `reflow_network.d.ts` - TypeScript definitions
  - `reflow_network_bg.wasm` - WebAssembly binary

## Comprehensive Test Suite

The comprehensive test suite (`comprehensive_test.js`) demonstrates:

### 1. üèóÔ∏è Graph Creation
- Creating graphs with metadata and properties
- Adding nodes with positioning and descriptions
- Establishing connections between nodes
- Setting up graph-level inports and outports
- Graph serialization and export functionality

### 2. üé≠ Stateful Actors
Four different actor types showcasing state management:

#### GeneratorActor
- Produces sequential numbers with configurable limits
- Maintains counter state and generation history
- Demonstrates state persistence across invocations

#### AccumulatorActor
- Calculates running totals and averages
- Tracks all processed values in state
- Shows precision-controlled mathematical operations

#### FilterActor
- Filters values based on configurable criteria
- Maintains separate counts for passed/filtered items
- Supports multiple filter types (range, even/odd)

#### LoggerActor
- Logs all messages with timestamps and metadata
- Maintains message history with configurable limits
- Tracks system uptime and performance metrics

### 3. üöÄ Network Composition
- Actor registration and binding to graph nodes
- Network startup with async/await support
- Real-time event monitoring and handling
- Graceful shutdown procedures

### 4. üìö Advanced Features
- Graph history with undo/redo capabilities
- State persistence and recovery mechanisms
- Comprehensive error handling and reporting
- Performance monitoring and statistics

## Running the Tests

### Option 1: Web Browser (Recommended)

1. **Build the WASM bindings** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   cd crates/reflow_network
   wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir pkg
   ```

2. **Serve the files** using a local web server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
   npx http-server -p 8000
   
   # Using any other static file server
   ```

3. **Open in browser**:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/example/comprehensive_test.html
   ```

4. **Run the tests** by clicking the "Run Comprehensive Test" button

### Option 2: Node.js Environment

1. **Install dependencies** (if using Node.js modules):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the test directly**:
   ```bash
   node --experimental-modules comprehensive_test.js
   ```

### Option 3: Manual Testing

You can also import and run individual components:

```javascript
import { 
  runComprehensiveTest,
  GeneratorActor,
  AccumulatorActor,
  createProcessingGraph 
} from './comprehensive_test.js';

// Run the full test suite
const result = await runComprehensiveTest();

// Or test individual components
const graph = createProcessingGraph();
const actor = new GeneratorActor();
```

## Expected Output

When running successfully, you should see:

### Web Interface
- Interactive progress bar showing test execution
- Real-time console output with timestamps
- Visual status indicators (success/error/running)
- Detailed results summary with statistics
- Clean, responsive UI with emoji indicators

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **WASM Module Not Found**
   - Ensure you've built the WASM bindings with `wasm-pack build`
   - Check that the `pkg/` directory exists and contains the generated files

2. **CORS Errors in Browser**
   - Use a local web server instead of opening HTML files directly
   - Ensure all files are served from the same origin

3. **Import/Export Errors**
   - Make sure you're using a modern browser that supports ES6 modules
   - Check that the file paths in import statements are correct

4. **Network Startup Failures**
   - Verify that all actor classes are properly registered
   - Check the browser console for detailed error messages

### Performance Notes

- The test suite runs for 5 seconds by default to demonstrate the pipeline
- You can modify the timing in the `createAndRunNetwork()` function
- Actor state is maintained in memory and will be lost on page refresh
- For production use, consider implementing persistent state storage

## Extending the Examples

### Adding New Actors

1. Create a new actor class following the pattern:
   ```javascript
   class MyActor {
     constructor() {
       this.inports = ["input"];
       this.outports = ["output"];
       this.state = new MemoryState();
       this.config = { /* your config */ };
     }
     
     run(input, send) {
       // Process input and update state
       // Send output using send()
     }
   }
   ```

2. Register the actor in the network:
   ```javascript
   network.registerActor("MyActor", MyActor);
   ```

3. Add nodes to the graph:
   ```javascript
   graph.addNode("myNode", "MyActor", { x: 100, y: 100 });
   ```

### Modifying the Pipeline

You can easily modify the data processing pipeline by:
- Changing actor configurations
- Adding new connections between actors
- Implementing different filtering or processing logic
- Adding new graph nodes and connections
