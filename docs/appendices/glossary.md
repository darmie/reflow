# Glossary

## A

**Actor**
: A fundamental unit of computation in Reflow that processes messages and can create other actors, send messages, or designate behavior for the next message.

**Actor Model**
: A mathematical model of concurrent computation that treats actors as the universal primitives of concurrent computation.

**API**
: Application Programming Interface - A set of protocols and tools for building software applications.

## C

**Component**
: A reusable unit of functionality in Reflow that can be connected to other components to build workflows.

**Connection**
: A link between two components that allows data or control flow to pass from one component to another.

**Concurrent Computation**
: Multiple computations executing at the same time, potentially interacting with each other.

## D

**Deno**
: A secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript built on V8, Chrome's JavaScript engine.

**Deployment**
: The process of releasing and configuring a Reflow application to run in a production environment.

## E

**Edge**
: In graph terminology, a connection between two nodes (components) that represents data or control flow.

**Event**
: A signal or message that indicates something has happened in the system.

## F

**Flow-Based Programming (FBP)**
: A programming paradigm that defines applications as networks of "black box" processes exchanging data across predefined connections.

## G

**Graph**
: A data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges that represent the connections between them. In Reflow, graphs represent workflows.

**GraphQL**
: A query language and runtime for APIs that provides a complete description of data in your API.

## I

**Inport**
: An input connection point on a component that receives data or control signals.

**Initial Information Packet (IIP)**
: A data packet that provides initial values to component inputs at the start of execution.

## M

**Message**
: A unit of communication between actors containing data and metadata.

**Message Passing**
: The primary means of communication between actors, where information is sent via discrete messages.

**Metadata**
: Data that provides information about other data, such as component properties or connection details.

## N

**Node**
: In graph terminology, a vertex that represents a component or processing unit in a workflow.

**Network**
: A collection of connected components that form a complete workflow or application.

## O

**Outport**
: An output connection point on a component that sends data or control signals to other components.

## P

**Port**
: A connection point on a component, either an inport (input) or outport (output).

**Process**
: A running instance of a component that can receive and send messages.

**Protocol**
: A set of rules that define how actors communicate with each other.

## R

**ReactFlow**
: A library for building node-based editors and interactive diagrams with React.

**Runtime**
: The execution environment where Reflow applications run, including the JavaScript/Deno runtime.

## S

**Serialization**
: The process of converting data structures or objects into a format that can be stored or transmitted.

**Subgraph**
: A subset of a larger graph that can be treated as a single component.

## T

**TypeScript**
: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions.

**Trait**
: A characteristic or property that defines the behavior or type of a port or component.

## V

**Visual Editor**
: A graphical user interface that allows users to create and modify workflows by dragging and dropping components.

## W

**WebAssembly (WASM)**
: A binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine, designed to be fast and portable.

**Workflow**
: A sequence of connected components that process data or perform tasks in a specific order.

**Web Worker**
: A JavaScript API that allows web pages to run scripts in background threads separate from the main execution thread.
