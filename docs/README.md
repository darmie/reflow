# Reflow Documentation

Welcome to the Reflow documentation! Reflow is a powerful, actor-based workflow execution engine built in Rust that supports multi-language scripting and cross-platform deployment.

## What is Reflow?

Reflow is a modular workflow engine that uses the actor model for concurrent, message-passing execution. It supports:

- **Multi-Language Scripting**: JavaScript (Deno), Python, and WebAssembly
- **Actor-Based Architecture**: Isolated, concurrent actors with message passing
- **Graph-Based Workflows**: Visual workflow representation with history/undo
- **Cross-Platform**: Native Rust execution + WebAssembly for browsers
- **Real-Time Capabilities**: Networking, WebSockets, and live data processing
